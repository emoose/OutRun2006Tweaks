[Performance]
# Set to 0 to disable this framelimiter if you want to use an external one instead.
#  (with FramerateUnlockExperimental enabled this can be increased above 60FPS without affecting game speed)

# Unlimits framerate during load screens to help reduce load times.
#  0 = disable
#  1 = unlimit framerate during load screens
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync during load screens (may cause screen flash)

[Controls]

# Makes Manual Transmission the default selection in C2C menus
#  (the menu animation will briefly show as Automatic, but Manual will be selected - spamming through menus will select Manual by default)
DefaultManualTransmission = false

# Allows assigning a keyboard key to toggle the game HUD
#  Depends on your keyboard layout which keys can be assigned here, some might work as-is (eg. P to bind it to P, or HOME to bind to Home)
#  Binding to a function key such as F10 should work fine on all keyboard layouts
HudToggleKey = 

# Enable/disable the xbox vibration code, or customise it

CarBaseShadowOpacity = 1.0

# Increases the distance that stage models will begin drawing at
#  This can help a lot with reducing pop-in of stage models, and make some distant views look a lot nicer
#  Note that the higher this is tweaked, the higher the chance that LOD models may appear earlier than they should, sometimes replacing the non-LOD version of the stage section...
#  4-8 should be a good range to increase distance & fix the worst pop-ins without LOD issues

# Allows customizing the track title font (certain fonts may be missing glyphs such as square brackets)

# Allows redirecting the Demonware master server to a custom server instead
#  This host should be hosting lobby/auth/STUN
