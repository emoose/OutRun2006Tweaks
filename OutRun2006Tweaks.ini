#  0 = disable
#  1 = unlimit framerate during load screens
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync during load screens (fastest load times but may cause screen flash)

[Graphics]
# Adjusts the UI scaling applied by the game
#  0 = game default, stretches to screen ratio
#  1 = fixed UI scaling without stretching, based on Outrun Online Arcade
#  2 = 4:3 UI centered to middle of screen
# Outrun Online Arcade scaling required many manual code changes, please let me know if you notice anything broken!
UIScalingMode = 0

# Adds 4:3 letterboxing to game menus, to address some graphical issues outside of the menus 4:3 display
#  0 = disable all letterboxing

FixZBufferPrecision = true

# Allows textures to be replaced if a matching texture exists inside textures\load\ folder
#  Textures must be named as [hash]_[width]x[height].dds, where hash/width/height comes from the original texture to be replaced

[CDSwitcher]
# Installs an aftermarket CD switcher onto each of your cars, switcher can be used to change music tracks during a race.
#  Track can be changed either using Q and E keyboard keys, or Back / RS+Back gamepad buttons
#  (gamepad buttons can be rebound below)

# Whether to display track title after switching
SwitcherDisplayTitle = true

[Vibration]

[Window]

# If the outrun2006.ini file doesn't exist, changes games default 640x480 resolution to primary display resolution instead
#  Otherwise the resolution from outrun2006.ini (or Config.exe tool) will be used
AutoDetectResolution = true

[Misc]
# Skips the beginning intro logos, saving a couple seconds from startup time. (game will still show a white screen for 5-10 seconds while data loads in)
#  Can also be enabled via -SkipIntros launch parameter.
SkipIntroLogos = false

# Disables the countdown timer, may be useful for modders, or those who just want to take a leisurely drive.
#  Can also be enabled via -OuttaTime launch parameter.

# Clarissa in O2SP arcade mode uses a different model in non-JP versions, this allows restoring the original JP model

FixPegasusClopping = true

# Fixes C2C scoreboard rankings not updating due to incomplete anti-piracy checks.

PreventDESTSaveCorruption = true

# Game tries to load in lens flare data from common/, but the game files have it inside media/, causing lens flare not to be drawn.
#  If lens flare is still present inside media/ then this will just patch game to load it from there instead.
FixLensFlarePath = true

# Fixes certain effects in the game like backfiring which tried to check if pedal/trigger is being fully pressed
#  (vanilla DirectInput wouldn't return a high enough value to register, this just nudges it toward the value being checked)
FixFullPedalChecks = true

# Hides text related to the now-defunct online service
HideOnlineSigninText = true

# Allows game to detect newly plugged in devices, rather than needing a restart
ControllerHotPlug = true

[CDTracks]
# Defines tracks and the order they can be selected via the CDSwitcher above
#  Tracks can be added/removed as desired, along with any custom WAV/OGG files
#  Format of each line should be

#
#  Full file paths can also be used, without requiring quotation marks, eg
#    C:\My Music\Outrun 2\Splash Wave Remix.wav = Splash Wave Remix
#
#  (note that this only affects tracks played through CDSwitcher, this currently doesn't affect the track selection menu in-game)
