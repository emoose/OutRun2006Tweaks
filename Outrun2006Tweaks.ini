# Framelimit: The max framerate for the game to use.
#  This will also override the fullscreen refresh rate that the game requests.
#  Set to 0 to disable this framelimiter, in case you want to use an external one instead.

# FramerateFastLoad: Unlimits framerate during load screens to help reduce load times.
#  0 = disable
#  1 = only unlimit framerate
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync (fastest, but may cause screen flash)

# FramerateUnlockExperimental: Prevents game from speeding up when playing with FramerateLimit above 60FPS.
#  Works by forcing game to only update at 60Hz, while rendering is allowed to run at a higher rate.
#  Though since game still runs at 60Hz internally this isn't as good as a true framerate unlock, but might still be useful for some.
#  (higher FPS also has issues with certain textures / UI elements being animated too quickly too, not too noticeable at 120/144, but can be disorientating at 3000+FPS)
#  Should be fine to leave this enabled in most cases, but if you have issues feel free to disable this here.
FramerateUnlockExperimental = true

# VSync: VSync present interval for game to use, set to 0 to disable VSync.
#  Will usually lock games framerate to screen-refresh-rate divided by VSync value.
#  eg. a 60Hz screen with VSync = 2 will result in 30Hz (half-refresh) vsync.
#  (if game isn't picking the correct screen-refresh-rate, try changing FramerateLimit above)

# DisableStageCulling: Disables culling of certain stage objects, so most distant objects won't obviously pop in to view.
