# FramerateLimit: The max framerate for the game to use.
#  Also overrides the fullscreen refresh rate that the game will request.
#  Set to 0 to disable this framelimiter if you want to use an external one instead.
#  (if game doesn't run at full framerate-limit setting, try checking with "DX/WINDOWED = 1" in outrun2006.ini)
FramerateLimit = 60

# FramerateLimitMode: Improves accuracy of the framerate limiter at a cost of higher CPU usage.
#  The default 0 should work fine for most people, but if you have issues it might be worth trying the accurate mode.
#  0 = efficient mode
#  1 = accurate mode
FramerateLimitMode = 0

# FramerateFastLoad: Unlimits framerate during load screens to help reduce load times.
#  0 = disable
#  1 = unlimit framerate during load screens
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync during load screens (fastest load times but may cause screen flash)
FramerateFastLoad = 1

# FramerateUnlockExperimental: Fixes game speeding up when playing with FramerateLimit above 60FPS.
#  Works by forcing game to only update at 60Hz, while rendering is allowed to run at a higher rate.
#  Since game still runs at 60Hz internally this isn't as good as a true framerate unlock, but might still be useful for some.
#  (some textures/UI elements may animate faster at higher FPS, but gameplay should remain the same speed)
#  Should be fine to leave this enabled in most cases, but if you have issues feel free to disable this here.
FramerateUnlockExperimental = true

# VSync: VSync present interval for game to use, set to 0 to disable VSync.
#  Will usually lock games framerate to screen-refresh-rate divided by VSync value.
#  eg. a 60Hz screen with VSync = 2 will result in 30Hz (half-refresh) vsync.
#  (if game isn't picking the correct screen-refresh-rate, try changing FramerateLimit above)
VSync = 1

[Window]
# WindowedBorderless: Forces windowed mode to become borderless.
#  Make sure to edit outrun2006.ini and set "DX/WINDOWED = 1" for borderless to become active.

# WindowPositionX / WindowPositionY: Position of the borderless window.
#  Only applied if WindowedBorderless is set to true.

# WindowedHideMouseCursor: Hides mouse cursor while game window is active.

# DisableDPIScaling: Disables DPI scaling on game window, can help fix issues when screen DPI is set above 100%
DisableDPIScaling = true

# AutoDetectResolution: If games outrun2006.ini doesn't exist or is empty, makes game use primary screen resolution instead of 640x480.
#  Also enables windowed mode + fog, and sets antialiasing to 2 - these can still be overridden through games Config.exe tool.
AutoDetectResolution = true

[Graphics]
# AnisotropicFiltering: Level of AF for game to use, 1 - 16, 0 to leave it at games default.
AnisotropicFiltering = 16

# TransparencySupersampling: Allows game to enable 4x transparency supersampling, heavily reducing aliasing on things like barriers or cloth around the track edge.
#  May only work on NVIDIA cards.
#  For best results use this with "DX/ANTIALIASING = 2" inside outrun2006.ini
TransparencySupersampling = true

# ScreenEdgeCullFix: Fixes certain stage objects being culled out before they reach edge of screen, when playing at non-4:3 aspect ratio.
ScreenEdgeCullFix = true

# DisableVehicleLODs: Disables LODs on vehicles, reducing the ugly pop-in they have.
DisableVehicleLODs = true

# DisableStageCulling: Disables culling of certain stage objects, so most distant objects won't obviously pop in to view.
DisableStageCulling = true

# FixZBufferPrecision: Fixes Z-Buffer precision issues, greatly reducing z-fighting and distant object drawing issues (eg. signs/buildings will have much less pop-in)
FixZBufferPrecision = true

[Misc]
# SkipIntroLogos: skips the beginning intro logos, saving a couple seconds from startup time.
#  (game will still show a white screen for 5-10 seconds while data loads in)
#  Can also be enabled via -SkipIntros launch parameter.
SkipIntroLogos = false

# DisableCountdownTimer: disables the countdown timer, may be useful for modders, or those who just want to take a leisurely drive.
#  Can also be enabled via -OuttaTime launch parameter.
DisableCountdownTimer = false

[Bugfixes]
# FixPegasusClopping: fixes looping clop sound effect remaining active through the session.
FixPegasusClopping = true

# FixC2CRankings: fixes C2C scoreboard rankings not updating due to incomplete anti-piracy checks.
#  (game still contained "SecuROM_Tripwire" checks inside it, despite Steam release not using SecuROM...)
FixC2CRankings = true

# PreventDESTSaveCorruption: prevents the save corruption caused by trying to remap controls with many devices connected.
#  This usually resulted in player name replaced with "DEST" and some garbage text, along with player character model disappearing along with all unlocks/miles.
#  (if you got hit by this bug, you can restore name/model by replacing first 0xB0 bytes in your corrupted License.dat file with the contents of a different one)
PreventDESTSaveCorruption = true

# FixLensFlarePath: game tries to load in lens flare data from common/, but the game files have it inside media/, causing lens flare not to be drawn.
#  If lens flare is still present inside media/ then this will just patch game to load it from there instead.
#  (if you already moved the lens flare file yourself then no change will be applied)
