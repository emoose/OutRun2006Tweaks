[Performance]
# Set to 0 to disable this framelimiter if you want to use an external one instead.
#  (with FramerateUnlockExperimental enabled, this can be increased above 60FPS without affecting game speed)
FramerateLimit = 60

# 0 = efficient mode
# 1 = accurate mode
# The default 0 should work fine for most people, but if you have issues it might be worth trying the accurate mode.
FramerateLimitMode = 0

# Unlimits framerate during load screens to help reduce load times.
#  0 = disable
#  1 = unlimit framerate during load screens
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync during load screens (fastest load times but may cause screen flash)
FramerateFastLoad = 1

# Should usually be fine to leave this enabled, but if you have frame issues feel free to disable this here.
FramerateUnlockExperimental = true

# Set to 0 to disable VSync, 1 for normal v-sync, or 2 for half-refresh-rate vsync
VSync = 1

[Vibration]
# Xbox Series controllers should be able to use impulse trigger vibration via X1nput 1.3 (later versions don't appear to work)
#   https://github.com/araghon007/X1nput/releases/tag/v1.3
# Just extract the X1nput.ini & 32-bit XInput1_3.dll from that ZIP to game folder, and rename XInput1_3.dll to XInput1_4.dll

# Enable/disable the xbox vibration code, or customise it
#  0 = disable
#  1 = enable xbox vibration code
#  2 = ^ with L/R motors swapped (recommended for impulse triggers)
#  3 = ^ with L/R motors merged together
VibrationMode = 0

# VibrationStrength range is 0 to 10
VibrationStrength = 10

# XInput device to send vibration to, default should work fine in most cases, but if you don't notice any vibration you can try increasing this here
VibrationControllerId = 0

[Window]
# Forces windowed mode to become borderless. (requires "DX/WINDOWED = 1" inside outrun2006.ini)
WindowedBorderless = true

# Only applied if WindowedBorderless is set to true.
WindowPositionX = 0
WindowPositionY = 0

# Hides mouse cursor while game window is active.
WindowedHideMouseCursor = true

# Disables DPI scaling on game window, can help fix issues when screen DPI is set above 100%
DisableDPIScaling = true

# If the outrun2006.ini file doesn't exist, changes games default 640x480 resolution to primary display resolution instead
#  Otherwise the resolution from outrun2006.ini (or Config.exe tool) will be used
AutoDetectResolution = true

[Graphics]
# 1 - 16, 0 to leave it at games default.
AnisotropicFiltering = 16

# Allows game to enable 4x transparency supersampling, heavily reducing aliasing on things like barriers or cloth around the track edge.
#  For best results use this with "DX/ANTIALIASING = 2" inside outrun2006.ini
TransparencySupersampling = true

# Fixes certain stage objects disappearing before they reach edge of screen, when playing at non-4:3 aspect ratio.
ScreenEdgeCullFix = true

# Disables LODs on vehicles, reducing the ugly pop-in they have.
DisableVehicleLODs = true

# Disables culling of certain stage objects, so most distant objects won't obviously pop in to view.
DisableStageCulling = true

# Fixes Z-Buffer precision issues, greatly reducing z-fighting and distant object drawing issues (eg. signs/buildings will have much less pop-in)
FixZBufferPrecision = true

# Allows textures to be replaced if a matching texture exists inside textures\load\ folder
#  Textures must be named as [hash]_[width]x[height].dds, where hash/width/height comes from the original texture to be replaced
#  They can also be kept in seperate subfolders for the texture package the original texture belongs to (or just kept inside the base texture\load\ folder)
#  You can find the correct filename/texture package name by enabling TextureDump below
StageTextureReplacement = true
UITextureReplacement = true

# Dumps out textures into textures\dump\ folder as the game loads them in, if a replacement texture isn't loaded
#  Textures will be dumped into separate subfolders for the texture package each texture belongs to
StageTextureDump = false
UITextureDump = false

[Misc]
# Skips the beginning intro logos, saving a couple seconds from startup time. (game will still show a white screen for 5-10 seconds while data loads in)
#  Can also be enabled via -SkipIntros launch parameter.
SkipIntroLogos = false

# Disables the countdown timer, may be useful for modders, or those who just want to take a leisurely drive.
#  Can also be enabled via -OuttaTime launch parameter.
DisableCountdownTimer = false

[Bugfixes]
# Fixes looping clop sound effect remaining active through the session.
FixPegasusClopping = true

# Fixes C2C scoreboard rankings not updating due to incomplete anti-piracy checks.
FixC2CRankings = true

# Prevents the "DEST" save corruption caused by remapping controls with many devices connected.
#  (if you got hit by this bug, you can restore name/model by replacing first 0xB0 bytes in your corrupted License.dat file with the contents of a different one)
PreventDESTSaveCorruption = true

# Game tries to load in lens flare data from common/, but the game files have it inside media/, causing lens flare not to be drawn.
#  If lens flare is still present inside media/ then this will just patch game to load it from there instead.
FixLensFlarePath = true
