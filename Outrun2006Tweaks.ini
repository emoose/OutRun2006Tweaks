# Framelimit: The max framerate for the game to use.
#  This will also override the fullscreen refresh rate that the game requests.
#  Set to 0 to disable this framelimiter, in case you want to use an external one instead.
#  (if game doesn't run at full framerate-limit setting, try checking with "DX/WINDOWED = 1" in outrun2006.ini)
FramerateLimit = 60

# FramerateLimitMode: Improves accuracy of the framerate limiter at a cost of higher CPU usage.
#  The default 0 should work fine for most people, but if you have issues it might be worth trying the accurate mode.
#  0 = efficient mode
#  1 = accurate mode
FramerateLimitMode = 0

# FramerateFastLoad: Unlimits framerate during load screens to help reduce load times.
#  0 = disable
#  1 = unlimit framerate during load screens
#  2 = unlimit framerate & disable vsync during load screens (fastest load times but may cause screen flash)
FramerateFastLoad = 1

# FramerateUnlockExperimental: Fixes game speeding up when playing with FramerateLimit above 60FPS.
#  Works by forcing game to only update at 60Hz, while rendering is allowed to run at a higher rate.
#  Since game still runs at 60Hz internally this isn't as good as a true framerate unlock, but might still be useful for some.
#  (some textures/UI elements may animate faster at higher FPS, but gameplay should remain the same speed)
#  Should be fine to leave this enabled in most cases, but if you have issues feel free to disable this here.
FramerateUnlockExperimental = true

# VSync: VSync present interval for game to use, set to 0 to disable VSync.
#  Will usually lock games framerate to screen-refresh-rate divided by VSync value.
#  eg. a 60Hz screen with VSync = 2 will result in 30Hz (half-refresh) vsync.
#  (if game isn't picking the correct screen-refresh-rate, try changing FramerateLimit above)

# AnisotropicFiltering: Level of AF for game to use, 1 - 16, 0 to leave it at games default.

# TransparencySupersampling: Allows game to enable 4x transparency supersampling, heavily reducing aliasing on things like barriers or cloth around the track edge.
#  May only work on NVIDIA cards.
#  For best results use this with "DX/ANTIALIASING = 2" inside outrun2006.ini

# ScreenEdgeCullFix: Fixes certain stage objects being culled out before they reach edge of screen, when playing at non-4:3 aspect ratio.
ScreenEdgeCullFix = true

# DisableVehicleLODs: Disables LODs on vehicles, reducing the ugly pop-in they have.
DisableVehicleLODs = true

# DisableStageCulling: Disables culling of certain stage objects, so most distant objects won't obviously pop in to view.
DisableStageCulling = true

# FixZBufferPrecision: Fixes Z-Buffer precision issues, heavily reducing z-fighting and distant object drawing issues (eg. signs/buildings will have much less pop-in)
