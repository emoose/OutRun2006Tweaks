# FramerateUnlockExperimental: forces game to update at 60Hz, while rendering can run at a higher rate (experimental!)
#  Prevents game from speeding up when playing with FramerateLimit above 60FPS.
#  Though since game is still running at 60Hz internally, so this isn't as good as a true framerate unlock, but might still be useful for some.
#  (currently higher FPS has issues with certain animated textures / UI elements being drawn too quickly, not too noticeable at 120/144, but can be disorientating at 3000+FPS)
#  Should be fine to leave this enabled in most cases, but if you have issues feel free to disable this here.

[Window]

#  Likely has a tiny performance hit, probably not noticeable on modern machines.

# DisableStageCulling: Disables culling of certain stage objects, so most distant objects won't obviously pop in to view.
