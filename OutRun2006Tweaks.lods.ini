# This file contains known-bad object IDs that will be excluded from being drawn by the DrawDistanceIncrease tweak
# Such as LOD models or other bad stage models
#
# OutRun2006Tweaks includes an overlay that can help to find the IDs for bad objects if they appear
# Just make sure [Overlay] Enabled = true is set, then press F11 when you see a bad model while playing a stage
#
# Please post any bad objects you find to https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/issues/97!
