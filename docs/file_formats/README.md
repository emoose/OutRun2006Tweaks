This folder contains some templates for [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) to define formats used in C2C / OR2, these formats can then be viewed/edited inside 010 Editors template view.

GZ/SZ files must be decompressed first (GZ seems to decompress with normal GZip tools, SZ requires `mkdir output; offzip -A file.sz output`)

After that the decompressed file can be loaded into 010 Editor, and the template can be opened via `Templates > Open Template`, & ran via `Templates > Run Template`

Values inside the file can be changed inside the template results window by double-clicking the existing value shown.
